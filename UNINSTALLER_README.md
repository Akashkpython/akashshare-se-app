## Building the C# Uninstaller

To compile the C# uninstaller into a standalone executable:

1. Install .NET SDK from https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download
2. Run the build-uninstaller.bat script

```

## Notes

- If the application was installed in a custom location, you may need to manually remove those files
- Some antivirus software may flag the uninstaller - this is a false positive due to the script's file removal capabilities
- The uninstallers will search multiple common installation locations to ensure complete removal
- All uninstallers provide clear console messages as requested:
  - "Type 'AkAsH' to uninstall the app:"
  - "Uninstall successful!" or "Incorrect name. Uninstall cancelled."
