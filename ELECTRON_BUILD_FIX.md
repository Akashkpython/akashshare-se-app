# Electron Build Configuration Fix

## Problem
The Electron Builder was failing with the error:
```
Application entry file "build\electron.js" in the "dist\win-unpacked\resources\app.asar" does not exist. Seems like a wrong configuration.
```

## Root Cause
- Electron Builder expected the main entry file to be at `build/electron.js`
- The package.json `main` field was pointing to `electron/main.js`
- During packaging, Electron Builder couldn't find the main file in the expected location

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated package.json Configuration
- Changed `main` field from `electron/main.js` to `build/electron.js`
- Added `electron:copy` script to copy Electron files during build
- Updated `electron-pack` and `dist` scripts to include the copy step
- Added `extraMetadata.main` to explicitly set the main file for Electron Builder

### 2. Created Copy Script
Created `scripts/copy-electron.js` that:
- Copies `electron/main.js` to `build/electron.js`
- Updates file paths to work from the build directory structure:
  - Preload script path: `../electron/preload.js`
  - HTML file path: `index.html` (relative to build directory)
  - Icon path: `logo192.png` (relative to build directory)
- Creates a minimal `package.json` in the build directory with correct main field

### 3. Build Process Flow
```bash
npm run dist
├── npm run build (React build)
├── npm run electron:copy (Copy and modify Electron files)
└── electron-builder --publish=never (Package the app)
```

## Files Modified
- `package.json` - Updated build configuration and scripts
- `scripts/copy-electron.js` - New file for copying Electron files

## Files Created
- `build/electron.js` - Modified main Electron file
- `build/package.json` - Minimal package.json for Electron

## Testing
Run the following commands to test the fix:
```bash
npm run build       # Build React app
npm run electron:copy # Copy Electron files
npm run dist        # Full build and package
```

## Result
The Electron app should now package correctly without the main file error, creating a distributable desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
